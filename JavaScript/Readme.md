This folder and its contents were created following [Cisco's JavaScript Essentials 1](https://www.netacad.com/courses/javascript-essentials-1) course.

If you are just approaching programming, do NOT use these files, and follow the proper course.

If you already have programming experience, feel free to peruse them, though I still suggest you to follow the course if you want to learn properly. They are great as reminders/notes to look at if unsure.
